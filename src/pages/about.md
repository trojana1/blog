Hey there! I'm Luna, a passionate and aspiring web developer with a love for creating beautiful, functional websites. I’m constantly learning new things and pushing myself to grow in this ever-evolving world of web development.

My journey into coding started a few years ago when I stumbled upon a free online course. What began as a hobby quickly turned into a full-blown obsession. I was amazed by how lines of code could come together to build something interactive and engaging. Since then, I’ve been diving deep into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and recently, a bit of React and Astro.

This blog is my little corner of the internet where I share my coding journey, tips and tricks I’ve learned along the way, and the occasional life update. I’m excited to connect with fellow developers, learners, and curious minds, so feel free to reach out. Let’s build something amazing together!

Thanks for stopping by!
